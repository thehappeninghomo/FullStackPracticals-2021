        Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in 
        which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext. 
        As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document 
        with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent 
        of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing 
        of scientific information between researchers.</p>
