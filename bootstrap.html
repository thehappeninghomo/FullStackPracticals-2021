    <p style="background-color:gray; text-align: justify; padding: 20px; color: white;" >Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for 
        creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework 
        for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is 
        the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and 
        Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to Bootstrap 
        developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source 
        project.</p>
