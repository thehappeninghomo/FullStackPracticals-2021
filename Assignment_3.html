    <h2>What is Fullstack development?</h2>
    <p>Fullstack development refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application. It mainly consists of three parts front end, back end, and database. Front end is the visible part of website or web application which is responsible for user experience. The user directly interacts with the front end portion of the web application or website. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.

    Back end refers to the server-side development of web application or website with a primary focus on how the website works. It is responsible for managing the database through queries and APIs by client-side commands. This type of web development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. Database is the collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports etc. All the information at the back end is saved in the database.
